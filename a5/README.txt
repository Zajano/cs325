in the Zack_Jaffe_A5 directory, enter 'make' into the command line. After the makefile has run, enter 'wrestler filename.txt' to run the executable with the text doc as an argument. If the file is successful, the console will print either "not possible" or "yes" with the heels and babyfaces.

if the executable doesn't run, you may need to enter "./wrestlers filename.txt" in the command line to run it.
