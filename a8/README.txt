in the Zack_Jaffe_A8 directory, enter 'make' into the command line. After the makefile has run, enter 'binpack' to run the executable. If the file is successful, the console will print a paragraph for each test case and the individual function outcomes.

if the executable doesn't run, you may need to enter "./binpack" in the command line to run it.
