in the mergesort directory, enter 'make' into the command line. After the makefile has run, enter 'mergesort' to run the executable. If the file is successful, a message will appear on the console saying the ordered lists have been written to merge.txt

if the executable doesn't run, you may need to enter "./mergesort" in the command line to run it.
